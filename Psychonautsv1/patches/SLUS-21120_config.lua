-- Bug#9176
--
-- This bug seems GPUGS interpolation problem.
-- The game draws clouds as undiscovered area on the map, but
-- Z value is unstable --- sometimes 0x320, sometimes 0x321.
-- On drawing 'Highlight' object (which is missing one), it uses z=0x320 with
-- ZTST=GEQUAL. Therefore if the cloud renders with z=0x321, this highlighted object
-- doesn't appear. But it's OK on the real PS2 because of no-drawing right edge,
-- z=0x321 won't be available on the packet (interpolation differences between
-- the real PS2 and our gs)
-- it gives some values (50.0f) to get +1 on Z value for the highlighted object.
-- this value will be used later to create the packet in _sprite_ps2_push_data(ESprite*).
--
-- This old one causes a problem on some other scenes.
